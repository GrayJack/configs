# My Configuration Files

Here lies all my config files that are a pain in the ass to configure from scratch

### Programs that I use

 * alacritty
 * atom
 * awesome
 * blueman-applet
 * compton
 * conky
 * dolphin
 * firefox
 * flameshot
 * fzf
 * hack nerdfont complete font
 * i3lock-color
 * indicator-kdeconnect
 * kate
 * kde plasma 5
 * nm-applet
 * powerlevel9k (zsh theme)
 * ranger
 * ripgrep (way faster than grep)
 * rofi
 * oh-my-zsh (zsh framework)
 * pulseaudio
 * pywal
 * xautolock
 * xrdb
 * zsh

### Tips
 * Awesome default user programs are in `.config/awesome/main/user-variables.lua`
 * SystemD service file for automatic lock screen for WM at `.config/awesome/suspendi3lock.service`
 * There some pywal custom templates in `.config/wal/templates/`, the contents of the alacritty one need to be copy and pasted inside the alacritty config
 * Install the zsh plugins in the `/home/$USER/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins/` folder
 * You have to change de Ethernet and Wireless port names in the conky config files to work as expected.
